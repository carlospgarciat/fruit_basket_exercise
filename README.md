# fruit_basket_exercise
Description: The good ol' fruit basket exercise to gauge devs code readability, proficiency, and data manipulation.
Note: The program was designed to run with files similar to the one received on the task. Using a csv with more than 4 columns or with different fiels will cause very weird results.Due to sense of urgency, error handling was ONLY introduced for parameter validation.

## Requirements:
- Python 2.7 and above (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- .csv file with the following columns: fruit, days, characteristic1, characteristic2

## Guide:
1. Download the file "solution.py" to where your csv file is located

2. Open your CLI / Terminal and navigate to where the "solution.py" file.
note: alternatively, you can choose to launch with a full path reference.

3. Use the following command the combination: <py> solution.py <file.csv>
*note: your bin ref may be different eg: python3 or python2 instead of just py
**note: if the csv file is not in the same folder, use the file path instead eg:
	C:\users\james\file.csv

### Examples:
- py solution.py my_file.csv
- python3 solution.py my_file.csv
- python3 c:\users\james\downloads\solution.py c:\users\james\documents\bascket.csv
